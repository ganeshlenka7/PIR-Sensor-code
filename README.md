PIR Motion Sensor with Arduino Uno R3

This project demonstrates how to interface a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor with an Arduino Uno R3 to detect movement and trigger an LED. When the PIR sensor detects motion, the LED turns on for one second, and a "Motion detected" message is printed on the Serial Monitor. If no motion is detected, the LED remains off, and "Motion not detected" is displayed.

How It Works

The PIR sensor continuously monitors infrared radiation in its range.

When motion is detected (digitalRead returns HIGH), the LED turns on, and a detection message is sent via Serial.

When no motion is detected (digitalRead returns LOW), the LED turns off, and a no-motion message is displayed.
